# Bearing Constraints Visualisation

Part of the Imperial Visualiations UROP. Learning tool to aid ME1 Design and Manufacture students understand the concept of shaft and bearing constraints, and to develop good engineering practice.

## Getting Started

To run the visualisation, open the **index.html** file in a web browser (Chrome or Firefox are recommended). The visualisation can also be accessed through the Imperial Visualisations webpage.

## Future Improvements

For those wishing to continue this project, a number of possible improvements for future versions may include:

* Changes to the HTML/CSS; improving the design, formatting and animations.

* An optional toggle to show drawing hidden features to more accurately represent an engineering drawing.

* A more dynamic design mode; component buttons are greyed out when they can no longer be added to the drawing.

* More depth of engineering understanding; introduce more complicated designs, constraints and restrictions.
